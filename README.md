This is my installer for Endeavour OS.
It's not shiny in any way and needs to be worked on but i'm on my way.


## Features

- Steam, Discord, Betterdiscordctl, Lutris, Protonup-QT, Wine dependency hell (thanks Glorious Eggroll!)
- btop, lolcat, neofetch, cowsay
- Installs yay if on manjaro or other arch based distro with no yay preinstalled
- HAS EXIT BUTON!!1!!!11
- NOW FEATURING REBOOT BUTON!
- Dotfiles etc coming soon! Be patient!


## Usage

Just run

```bash
 bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lemi-01/installer/main/installer.sh)

```
And select 1-3 options what to do.
1. Intall packages i use
2. Install yay
3. Dark GNOME/Wallpaper and neofetch config
4. REBOOT
5. EXIT

It will always return to menu after completing task and you can just easily exit from there by pressing 3 or crtl+c.
