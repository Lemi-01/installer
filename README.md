# Endeavour OS installer

This is my installer for Endeavour OS.
It's not shiny in any way and needs to be worked on but i'm on my way.



## Usage

Just run

```bash
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lemi-01/installer/main/installer.sh -O /tmp/installer.sh && bash /tmp/installer.sh && rm /tmp/installer.sh

```
And select 1-3 options what to do.
1. Intall packages i use
2. Install yay
3. EXIT

It will always return to menu after completing task and you can just easily exit from there by pressing 3.
